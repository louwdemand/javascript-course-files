JavaScript Operators
Operators are for Mathematical and Logical Computations
The Assignment Operator = assigns values

The Addition Operator + adds values

The Multiplication Operator * multiplies values

The Comparison Operator > compares values

JavaScript Assignment
The Assignment Operator (=) assigns a value to a variable:

Assignment Examples
let x = 10;
// Assign the value 5 to x
let x = 5;
// Assign the value 2 to y
let y = 2;
// Assign the value x + y to z:
let z = x + y;
JavaScript Addition
The Addition Operator (+) adds numbers:

Adding
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;
JavaScript Multiplication
The Multiplication Operator (*) multiplies numbers:

Multiplying
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x * y;
Types of JavaScript Operators
There are different types of JavaScript operators:

Arithmetic Operators
Assignment Operators
Comparison Operators
Logical Operators
And more ...
JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

Arithmetic Operators Example
let a = 3;
let x = (100 + 50) * a;
Operator	Description
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
**	Exponentiation
/	Division
%	Modulus (Division Remainder)
++	Increment
--	Decrement
Note
Arithmetic operators are fully described in the JS Arithmetic chapter.

JavaScript String Addition
The + can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:

Example
let text1 = "John";
let text2 = "Doe";
let text3 = text1 + " " + text2;
The += assignment operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:

Example
let text1 = "What a very ";
text1 += "nice day";
The result of text1 will be:

What a very nice day
Note
When used on strings, the + operator is called the concatenation operator.

Adding Strings and Numbers
Adding two numbers, will return the sum as a number like 5 + 5 = 10.

Adding a number and a string, will return the sum as a concatenated string like 5 + "5" = "55".

Example
let x = 5 + 5;
let y = "5" + 5;
let z = "Hello" + 5;
The result of x, y, and z will be:

10
55
Hello5
Note
If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string!

JavaScript Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

The Addition Assignment Operator (+=) adds a value to a variable.

Assignment
let x = 10;
x += 5;
Operator	Example	Same As
=	x = y	x = y
+=	x += y	x = x + y
-=	x -= y	x = x - y
*=	x *= y	x = x * y
/=	x /= y	x = x / y
%=	x %= y	x = x % y
**=	x **= y	x = x ** y
Note
Assignment operators are fully described in the JS Assignment chapter.

JavaScript Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

Comparison operators always return true or false.

Example
let x = 5;
let result = x > 8;
Operator	Description	Example
==	equal to	x == 5
===	equal value and equal type	x === 5
!=	not equal	x != 5
!==	not equal value or not equal type	x !== 5
>	greater than	x > 5
<	less than	x < 5
>=	greater than or equal to	x >= 5
<=	less than or equal to	x <= 5
All the comparison operators above can also be used on strings:

Example
let text1 = "A";
let text2 = "B";
let result = text1 < text2;
Note that strings are compared alphabetically.

Note
Comparison operators are fully described in the JS Comparisons chapter.

JavaScript Logical Operators
Operator	Description
&&	logical and
||	logical or
!	logical not
